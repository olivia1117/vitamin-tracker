# Welcome to Vitamin-Tracker!

## Overview
This is a simple web app created by Olivia Adamic for users to track their daily supplement intake. The data entry process starts on the second page where users can enter in how much of each supplement they took as well as click checkboxes next to the ones they want to add to a shopping list for later. Once they submit the data, there will be a confirmation response triggered and users will then be able to navigate back to the home page. Then to view their shopping list, users can click on a separate button to view it on the page. If they want to download their data as a csv file, there is also another button provided for that function as well. 

## Future Features
These are the additional features I hope to implement: 
-- Hosting my static site separately through Google Hosting and then having a separate server site as well 
-- Publishing my work consistently to Github with test and production branches for best practice
-- Learning how to secure any app data and keys properly 
-- An authentication system where users can login/signup either through a Google account or by creating a new account with a separate email and password. They will also have a basic profile and account settings options
-- Integration with an API that will allow the user to find supplements from their shopping list to order online through Amazon, Walmart, Fullscript, etc for more accessibility 
-- A responsive and intuitive UI that allows for the same great experience across multiple device types such as PC, tablet, phone, etc possibly through the use of Bootstrap
-- A Google Firebase database so that users can store their data there instead of or in addition to a csv and be able to retrieve it
